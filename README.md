# AeroSSP

This is my personal Python learning repository.  
I'm just starting out with Python, and this repo will contain all the practice code, experiments, and mini-projects I make while learning.

## 🎯 Why I Made This

- To learn Python from scratch
- To experiment with small code snippets and logic problems
- To track my progress in one place (publicly)

## 🧠 What You'll Find (Eventually)

- Basic programs (print, input, loops, etc.)
- Small logic problems (calculator, converters, etc.)
- Simple projects with clear goals
- Experiments with Python libraries (once I learn them)

## 📅 Current Status

I'm completely new to Python. Right now, this repo may only have:

- Very basic files
- Heavily commented code
- Mistakes and corrections

I'll keep adding code here as I learn new concepts.
